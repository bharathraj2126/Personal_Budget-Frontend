# d3-transition

A transition is a [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection)-like interface for animating changes to the DOM. Instead of applying changes instantaneously, transitions smoothly interpolate the DOM from its current state to the desired target state over a given duration.

To apply a transition, select elements, call [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition), and then make the desired changes. For example:

```js
d3.select("body")
  .transition()
    .style("background-color", "red");
```

Transitions support most selection methods (such as [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr) and [*transition*.style](#transition_style) in place of [*selection*.attr](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_attr) and [*selection*.style](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_style)), but not all methods are supported; for example, you must [append](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_append) elements or [bind data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#joining-data) before a transition starts. A [*transition*.remove](#transition_remove) operator is provided for convenient removal of elements when the transition ends.

To compute intermediate state, transitions leverage a variety of [built-in interpolators](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate). [Colors](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateRgb), [numbers](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber), and [transforms](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateTransform) are automatically detected. [Strings](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateString) with embedded numbers are also detected, as is common with many styles (such as padding or font sizes) and paths. To specify a custom interpolator, use [*transition*.attrTween](#transition_attrTween), [*transition*.styleTween](#transition_styleTween) or [*transition*.tween](#transition_tween).

## Installing

If you use npm, `npm install d3-transition`. You can also download the [latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/releases/latest). For vanilla HTML in modern browsers, import d3-transition from Skypack:

```html
<script type="module">

import {transition} from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/d3-transition@3";

const t = transition();

</script>
```

For legacy environments, you can load d3-transition’s UMD bundle from an npm-based CDN such as jsDelivr; a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-color@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-dispatch@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-ease@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-interpolate@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-selection@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-timer@3"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3-transition@3"></script>
<script>

const t = d3.transition();

</script>
```

### Selecting Elements

Transitions are derived from [selections](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition). You can also create a transition on the document root element using [d3.transition](#transition).

<a name="selection_transition" href="#selection_transition">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>transition</b>([<i>name</i>]) · [Source](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/selection/transition.js)

Returns a new transition on the given *selection* with the specified *name*. If a *name* is not specified, null is
