## Pure JS character encoding conversion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite)

 * Doesn't need native code compilation. Works on Windows and in sandboxed environments like [Cloud9](http://c9.io).
 * Used in popular projects like [Express.js (body_parser)](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser), 
   [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and others.
 * Faster than [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) (see below for performance comparison).
 * Intuitive encode/decode API
 * Streaming support for Node v0.10+
 * [Deprecated] Can extend Node.js primitives (buffers, streams) to support all iconv-lite encodings.
 * In-browser usage via [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) (~180k gzip compressed with Buffer shim included).
 * Typescript [type definition file](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/lib/index.d.ts) included.
 * React Native is supported (need to explicitly `npm install` two more modules: `buffer` and `stream`).
